# CSCIE-31_final_project
A web app build with the MEAN stack

This is the final project for CSCIE-31: Web application development with Node.js. This class was about how to use the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack and examined the MVC architecture pattern through that lense. This project is an application for leaving reviews for the Boston subway system. The app is not able to be run as a demo because the MongoDB instance, which was running on a Digital Ocean droplet, is not longer available.
